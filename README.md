# HashFrog Tracker

This is a tracker for the [Ocarina of Time Randomizer](https://ootrandomizer.com/). It's available at [https://hashfrog.wafo.dev](https://hashfrog.wafo.dev).

## About
The motivation behind this project is to have a simple customizable tracker that will help keep track of all the checks in the game.

## Build

The project is based on the React Create App, so the following scripts are available:

- `npm start` Runs the app in the development mode.
- `npm test` Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build` Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm run eject` This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
